## Topics Covered

1. **Writing Unit Tests**  
   - Understanding the **Arrange, Act, Assert** pattern.
   - Decoupling dependencies for better test isolation using mocks and stubs.

2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**  
   - Implementing TDD to drive the development process by writing tests first.
   - Using TDD to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

3. **Running Unit Tests with GitHub Actions**  
   - Automating the execution of unit tests using **GitHub Actions**.
   - Continuous integration setup for running tests on every push and pull request.

## Project Overview

The repository contains a simple console application with corresponding unit tests. The unit tests are designed following the principles of TDD and dependency decoupling. A GitHub Actions workflow is set up to automatically run these tests to ensure code quality in each commit.
